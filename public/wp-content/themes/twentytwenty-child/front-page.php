		<p style=display:none class='displayInfo' id="jacqInfo"> Started off my journey into Finance as a Civil Servant within HMRC, which quickly illustrated the desire not to be restricted by a title. 
		Spent almost a decade assimilating myself into a thriving community & corporate sector, still within the Finance world, but gathering an interest in how closely connected the corporate/private sector compounded the disenfranchised.  The realisation that this was by design, affected my entire discipline of ‘working hard & you will achieve’.
		Despondently, I left the Finance sector & returned to the UK & retrained in Social Services with the desire to change the world, but also aware of the structural set up ingrained in the system.
		After almost a decade of failing to change the world, it was evident with the socioeconomics of every path, that to make change it required amalgamations of several industries & conversing with people of similar interest.

		<p style=display:none class='displayInfo'style id="grahamInfo" > Obviously, I entered the Media Industry  See here: <a style="display: contents text-decoration:none" href= "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1485418/?ref_=nv_sr_2?ref_=nv_sr_2" >IMDB</a> This has become a two-decade case study on the complexity of humans congregated in several covertly optimistic settings, making achievements against parity & deprivation.
		With the advancement of age & the constant reminder that the desire (which never wavered) for implementing a different viewpoint to the mindset, is and continues to be achievable as the technology & access allows for a far-reaching effect in effecting change, I continue the march.
		In its simplistic terms with several collaborators & myself, we have started the catalyst to create multiple ventures throughout, which can be used a template all over the world in assisting the disenfranchised & community and also amplifying diverse & inclusion, with a view to rewiring the consciousness to afford a sustainable living thus creating a breach in the regular systematic impressions.
